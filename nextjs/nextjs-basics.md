What is the difference between a Library and a Framework

Next.js is a React FRAMEWORK. Built on top of the React library.

A library and a framework are both reusable code written by someone else. They help us solve common problems simply.

A library lets you use the code as and when you like.

A framework is Next.js is more rigid: you have limited choices as to where and how you use the code.

The tradeoff of these limitations is that the framework does a lot of work behind the scenes.

What is Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications (And perhaps create these fast too).

The building blocks it contains provide pre-built solutions for the main concepts, like user interface, routing, data fetching, infrastructure, etc.
