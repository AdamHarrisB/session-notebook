The concept of a variable
A variable is a container for a value.

var - (outdated, not used anymore)
let - (creates a variable that can be changed)
const - (creates a variable that can not be changed)

Two kinds of non-value in variables
undefined - (variable not yet given a value)
null - (an intentional null value)
