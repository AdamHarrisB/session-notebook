Shell and Terminal

Users commonly use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to interact with computers.

Developers tend to user CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) which are text based user interfaces. You use commands to interact with the computer creating, moving, deleting. etc.

The advantages of this:

    Many tools don't have a GUI and can only be used as a CLI.

    You can write scripts to automate processes and save time.

    On macOS we are using zsh (z shell)

    By default this is run in the Terminal. iTerm and Visual Studio Code are alternative terminal emulators.

A shell is the command interpreter that runs and executes commands and outputs results.

A terminal is a text input and output enviroment that sends commands to the shell, and displays the output.

Some sample commands

ls, cd .., pwd, open ., cat <filename>, etc.
