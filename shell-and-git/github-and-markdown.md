##Git and Commits

Git is an open source version control system

It keeps track of all changes made to the source code.
Enables developers to easily collaborate on the same project
Enables developers to go back to earlier versions of the source code.

##Git Repositories

Git repositories are where a project is saved, it keeps track of all version of a project file, many people can have access to the same repository.

Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Like hitting save in a video game.

You can always go back to any prior commit.

Each commit should include a descriptive text, so that other developers know what changes it includes.

##Good Commit Messages

Be short and descriptive
Always use English
the first word should be a verb "add" "fix" "remove", etc.
Use the imperative and present tense. "add shop page" instead of "added shop page"
Do not end with a full stop
When in doubt describe WHY you did something instead of HOW. "fix typo" not "replaced the letter a with the letter e in the second word"

GitHub

At the same time GitHub is a social network for developers and companies. Your GitHub profile will be valuable public asset for your future career.

Create a branch and switch to it with:
    git switch -c "branch-name"
It looks like I've done things correctly.
